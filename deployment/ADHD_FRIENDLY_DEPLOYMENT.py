🚀 QUICK START DEPLOYMENT GUIDE 🚀
=================================

📋 WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
- Ubuntu 22.04 VM (already set up)
- Basic terminal knowledge
- About 15-20 minutes of time

🔍 OVERVIEW:
1. Copy files to your server
2. Install required packages
3. Set up the database
4. Start the application
5. Access your wardrobe app!

💡 TIP: You can copy-paste each command block directly into your terminal.

# STEP 1: COPY FILES TO YOUR SERVER
# ---------------------------------
"""
📁 STEP 1: COPY FILES TO YOUR SERVER
===================================

Option A - Using Git (if you have a repository):
```
git clone https://your-repository-url.git clothing_database
cd clothing_database
```

Option B - Using SCP (if you have the files locally):
```
scp -r /path/to/clothing_database_project username@your-server-ip:~/clothing_database
cd ~/clothing_database
```

Option C - Direct download (if you have a zip file):
```
wget https://your-file-url/clothing_database.zip
unzip clothing_database.zip -d clothing_database
cd clothing_database
```

✅ CHECKPOINT: You should now be in a directory with app.py and other project files.
```
ls
```
You should see: app.py, db_operations.py, outfit_generator.py, and other files.

For production (keeps running after you log out):
```
nohup python3 app.py > app.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > app.pid
```

✅ CHECKPOINT: Verify the app is running:
```
# If running in testing mode, you'll see output in the terminal
# If running in production mode, check:
ps aux | grep app.py
cat app.log
```
"""

# STEP 5: ACCESS YOUR WARDROBE APP
# ------------------------------
"""
🌐 STEP 5: ACCESS YOUR WARDROBE APP
